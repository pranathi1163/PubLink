## OBJECTIVE
This project is a streamlined system designed to help users interact with a subset of the PubMed dataset. By selecting a model and inputting a query, the system retrieves the top 3 most relevant documents with similarity scores. Users can then summarize the retrieved documents using an API-powered GROQ model and visualize the summary with a word cloud.
